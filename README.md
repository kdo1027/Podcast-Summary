# Podcast Summary Web App

This project is a Streamlit app to summarize podcast episodes, integrating the listennotes API to download podcast information based on ID. I use the AssemblyAI API to transcribe the podcast and also generate the auto-chapters.

Run the following commands in the terminal:

 ```sh
  streamlit run main.py
  ```

Go to https://www.listennotes.com/ and get the ID of a random podcast episode
